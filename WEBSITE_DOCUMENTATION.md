## SECTION 3: WHY THESE PROGRAMS MATTER

**Educational Gap in Pakistan:**
Pakistan faces challenges in quality STEM education access, particularly for students in smaller cities and underserved areas. Many students lack opportunities for advanced mathematics training and competition exposure.

**SundarSTEM's Approach:**
These four programs address different educational needs:

1. **RMC** provides regular mathematical practice and assessment for schools, creating a culture of problem-solving and analytical thinking at the institutional level.

2. **PMC-5** identifies and rewards mathematical talent at the national level, providing incentives (prizes, laptops, training) that encourage excellence and create role models.

3. **VSS** delivers comprehensive STEM education to students who may not have access to quality science and mathematics instruction in their schools.

4. **ILM** offers unlimited practice opportunities, allowing any motivated student to improve their skills regardless of location or economic status.

**Program Importance:**
- **Talent Development:** Identifies and nurtures mathematically gifted students
- **Access and Equity:** Provides free quality education regardless of student's economic background
- **Competition Preparation:** Prepares Pakistani students for international mathematics olympiads
- **STEM Pipeline:** Creates pathway for students to pursue STEM careers
- **National Capacity:** Builds Pakistan's human capital in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics

**Impact:**
- Over 50 schools actively participating in RMC
- Thousands of students competing in PMC-5 annually
- Students from all provinces accessing VSS education
- Continuous skill development through ILM platform
